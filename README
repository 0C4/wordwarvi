To build, just type "make"

You'll need portaudio (v 19, not 18) and libsndfile 
(portaudio-devel and libsndfile-devel rpm packages)
and oggdec (vorbis-tools rpm package) to decode the 
included ogg files for sound to work.

See: http://www.portaudio.com/ and http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/

To build without any sound support, type "make WITHAUDIO=no"
