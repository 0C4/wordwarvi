.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
wordwarvi, or "Word War vi", is an old school '80's style side 
scrolling space shoot'em up video game.
.PP 
You pilot your "vi-per" craft through core memory, trying to
avoid OS defenses and wipe out the memory hogging emacs processes
and rescue lost vi-per pilots (.swp files) stranded from crashed 
vi sessions before heading through the socket to the next node 
in the cluster to do it all over again.
.SH Options:
.TP
\fB\--bw\fR
No color, just black and white.
.TP
\fB\--blueprint\fR
Render the game to look like a blueprint.
.TP
\fB\--brightsparks\fR
Enables a visual effect for sparks to be rendered bigger 
and brighter than usual, at the cost of some performance.
It is a matter of personal preference whether it looks better
or worse.
.TP
\fB\--framerate f\fR
Sets the target frame rate to f frames per second.
The default is 30 frames per second.  If your computer is
too slow to achieve the specified (or default) frame rate at 
the specified (or default) resolution, decreasing the frame 
rate may make the game respond better.  Likewise, at lower 
resolutions, higher framerates may be possible, or lower resolutions
may make the game perform better at a given frame rate. 
It should be noted that The game is designed (and tested) 
to be played at 30 frames per second.
.TP
\fB\--fullscreen\fR
Expand the window to fill the screen.  This option overrides the 
--width and --height options, if either of those are also specified, 
and scales the graphics to the size of the screen.
.TP
\fB\--height h\fR
Sets the window size to h pixels high, scaling all
graphics as necessary.  The default is 600 pixels.
.TP
\fB\--joystick joystick-device\fR
Use the specified device node joystick-device to access
the joystick.  The default device if this option is not used
is /dev/input/js0.  If you have more than one joystick, or if
your OS presents joysticks at device nodes other than 
/dev/input/js0, that's what this option is for.
.TP
\fB\--nomusic\fR
Don't play music, or even decode the music files into memory.
Cuts down considerably on memory usage.
.TP
\fB\--nostarfield\fR
Don't draw a starfield in the background.
.TP
\fB\--retrogreen\fR
Does exactly what it sounds like.
.TP
\fB\--sounddevice n\fR
Use alternate sound device n, where n is an integer.  
By default, wordwarvi uses the "default" sound device as 
estimated by the PortAudio library, which is 0.  
You can specify other numbers if you have other sound cards, or
a multichannel sound card.
.TP
\fB\--version\fR
Print the program's version number and exit.
.TP
\fB\--width w\fR
Sets the window size to w pixels wide, scaling all graphics
as necessary.  The default is 800 pixels.
.SH Controls:
.PP 
Arrow keys control movement (or vi's hjkl keys will work too,
of course.)
.PP
Q puts in a quarter, and starts the game.
.PP
Z fires a laser
.PP
C drops chaff (to confuse heat seeking missiles).
.PP
B drops bombs.
.PP
G drops a gravity bomb, of which you start with 3.
.PP
Additionally, a game pad or joystick may be used.  I have only tried
using a Logitech Dual Action Rumble USB gamepad.  On this, the first
(left) joystick controls your ship, and the top right trigger button
fires the laser, while the bottom right trigger button drops bombs.
(Just press all the buttons to see what they do.)

.SH ENEMIES AND OTHER THINGS YOU MAY ENCOUNTER
.PP 
Rockets.  Avoid hitting them.
.PP 
Heat seeking SAMs.  Avoid.
.PP 
Octo-viruses and tentacles.  Shoot lightning.  Avoid.
.PP 
Blimps (representing emacs).  Will shoot heat seeking missiles.  
Will leak LISP code.
.PP 
GDB processes.  Will attempt to ptrace you with heat seeking probes.  Avoid and/or kill.
.PP 
Cron Jobs.  Will shoot projectiles at you.  Will attempt to collect the vi .swp files
and carry them to caldera of the volcano, Mount /dev/null. 
.PP
Fuel tanks.  Refuel by hovering over the fuel tanks momentarily.
.PP 
Laser cannons.  They will shoot laser bolts at you (obviously).
.PP
WINE bottles.  Bill Gates's finest warship is outfitted with a
giant WINE bottle to enable it to travel through the linux CORE.
Beware of viruses which may be living inside.
.PP 
.SH FILES
.PP
/dev/input/js0, the joystick device node.
.PP
/usr/share/wordwarvi/sounds/*.ogg contain the audio data used by the game.
.SH GOOD LUCK
