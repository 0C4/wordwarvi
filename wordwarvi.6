.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
wordwarvi, or "Word War vi", is an old school '80's style side 
scrolling space shoot'em up video game.  It relies on Gnome for
graphics platform, and libsndfile and libportaudio for sound.
.PP 
You pilot your "vi-per" craft through core memory, trying to
avoid OS defenses and wipe out the memory hogging emacs processes
and rescue lost vi-per pilots (.swp files) stranded from crashed 
vi sessions before heading through the socket to the next node 
in the cluster to do it all over again.
.SH Options:
.TP
\fB\--bw\fR
No color, just black and white.
.TP
\fB\--height h\fR
Sets the window size to h pixels high, scaling all
graphics as necessary.
.TP
\fB\--sounddevice n\fR
Use alternate sound device n, where n is an integer.  
By default, wordwarvi uses the "default" sound device as 
estimated by the PortAudio library, which is 0.  
You can specify other numbers if you have other sound cards, or
a multichannel sound card.
.TP
\fB\--brightsparks\fR
Enables a visual effect for sparks to be rendered bigger 
and brighter than usual, at the cost of some performance.
It is a matter of personal preference whether it looks better
or worse.
.TP
\fB\--version\fR
Print the program's version number and exit.
.TP
\fB\--width w\fR
Sets the window size to w pixels wide, scaling all graphics
as necessary.
.SH Controls:
.PP 
Arrow keys control movement (or vi's hjkl keys will work too,
of course.)
.PP
Q puts in a quarter, and starts the game.
.PP
Z fires a laser
.PP
C drops chaff (to confuse heat seeking missiles).
.PP
B drops bombs.
.PP
Additionally, a game pad or joystick may be used.  I have only tried
using a Logitech Dual Action Rumble USB gamepad.  On this, the first
(left) joystick controls your ship, and the top right trigger button
fires the laser, while the bottom right trigger button drops bombs.
(Just press all the buttons to see what they do.)

.SH ENEMIES AND OTHER THINGS YOU MAY ENCOUNTER
.PP 
Rockets.  Avoid hitting them.
.PP 
Heat seeking SAMs.  Avoid.
.PP 
Octo-viruses and tentacles.  Shoot lightning.  Avoid.
.PP 
Blimps (representing emacs).  Will shoot heat seeking missiles.  
Will leak LISP code.
.PP 
GDB processes.  Will attempt to ptrace you with heat seeking probes.  Avoid and/or kill.
.PP 
Cron Jobs.  Will shoot projectiles at you.  Will attempt to collect the vi .swp files
and carry them to caldera of the volcano, Mount /dev/null. 
.PP
Fuel tanks.  Refuel by hovering over the fuel tanks momentarily.
.PP 
Laser cannons.  They will shoot laser bolts at you (obviously).
.PP
WINE bottles.  Bill Gates's finest warship is outfitted with a
giant WINE bottle to enable it to travel through the linux CORE.
Beware of viruses which may be living inside.
